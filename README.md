About:
Developed a multiplication table in which the user can input the amount of rows and columns. Once the user submits the table will change to that amount of rows and columns. If the user only inputs one of the choices then both the row and column will result in the one input. For example if the user input 20 for the row then both row and column will be 20. The user also can change the color of the table with the choices at the bottom and they can reset the table back to normal when clicking reset. 
 
 
Achievement: 
I'm proud of this project because it's the first big project I've used nested loops while at the same time manipulating the DOM. I also was able to highlight rows, columns, and even each cell when hovering over the table. It's also my first project where I give the user the choice to pick a color and it will stay throughout the changes of the table.
