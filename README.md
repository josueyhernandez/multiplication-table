# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Multiplication Table

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

1.) Make a nested for loop for making the table, loop for the row and loop for column (console.log to see if it shows a multiplication table just with numbers)
2.) Use HTML and CSS to actually make it into a table
3.) After that I want the top row and first column to display the numbers being multiply
4.) Create a function or a way that if I click increment another row and column would be added. Create a decrement as well
    (maybe with useState? If not then with simple javascript using ++)

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_
